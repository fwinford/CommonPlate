 *    redemption — or the same person's retry — reports the success that already
 *    happened rather than an invalid code.
 * 3. The digest-matched-but-unusable read. A code that is *right* but arrives
 *    after its replay window closed, or against a challenge whose attempts are
 *    spent, is not a wrong guess and must not spend one.
 * 4. The attempt decrement. Reached only by a code that is genuinely wrong.
 *    Deliberately not conditioned on `redeemedAt`: a redeemed challenge is
 *    still one whose code yields authority, so guessing against it has to be
 *    bounded by the same five attempts. Without that, redemption would open an
 *    unlimited guessing window against a live credential.
 * 5. Classification of the remainder, which mutates nothing.
