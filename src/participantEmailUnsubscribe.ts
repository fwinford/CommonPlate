 * W3-N2 participant-authorized email unsubscribe.
 *
 * A second path to the same declarative Off result `unsubscribeSubscriber.ts`
 * already reaches from an emailed credential. This one is reached from a
 * backend-resolved participant principal instead of a signed link: the caller
 * (`participantEmailUnsubscribeRoute.ts`) never supplies an email or a
 * Subscriber ID — the exact normalized address comes only from
 * `resolveParticipantAuthority`.
 *
 * Absent, pending, confirmed, and already-unsubscribed all converge to the
 * same result and the same atomic shape: no lookup-then-branch that could let
 * a caller learn which one it found. No Participant ID, participant
 * principal-resolution detail, or Subscriber identifier is written back onto
 * the Subscriber; the only new relationship this operation creates is the
 * mutation itself.
 *
 * Does not touch `unsubscribeCredentialVersion` — the same reason the emailed
 * credential's redemption does not: unsubscribing is not revocation, and an
 * already-emailed unsubscribe link must keep working afterwards.
