 * output cannot say whether that is one item seen twice or two identical
 * items ordered — collapsing to one, keeping both, or adding quantities
 * would each be a guess.
 *
 * The only provenance available is how many screenshots were analyzed:
 *
 * - One screenshot cannot overlap with itself, so repeated identical lines
 *   are separate order lines and every line is kept, as before W4-R4.
 * - With several screenshots, a repeated identity is ambiguous and is
 *   `null`: the caller proposes no meal items (and no swipe count, which
 *   depends on the same question) rather than a list that silently gained
 *   or lost an item. Lines that differ in quantity or any modifier are
