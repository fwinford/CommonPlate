 * The credential travels in a header rather than in the body. Three reasons,
 * all of them structural: the claim route's body is empty and the extension
 * route's body is length-checked to exactly one key, so a body field would have
 * to loosen two accepted schemas; a header keeps person-identity credentials
 * out of payloads that get echoed into validation errors; and it means the gate
 * can run before body validation, so an unverified caller learns nothing about
 * whether their payload would otherwise have been accepted.
 *
 * Backend truth is authoritative here and nowhere else. A signature that
 * verifies is not enough — the named Participant must still exist and still be
 * at the version the credential was signed at — so a revoked or deleted
 * identity is refused even though the device still holds a well-formed
 * credential. That is what makes the client's remembered state presentation
 * rather than authority.
