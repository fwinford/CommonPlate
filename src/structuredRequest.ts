/**
 * W4-R4 structured meal-request representation.
 *
 * This module owns the one authoritative shape a CommonPlate request is
 * submitted, validated, persisted, and projected in. It replaces the pre-R4
 * flat `food` + `pickupName` + meal-swipes-only representation.
 *
 * Two mutually exclusive menu paths exist, and a request is always exactly
 * one of them:
 *
 * - `meal-exchange` — 1 to 5 meal swipes, one required structured meal-detail
 *   entry per selected swipe, plus an optional Dining Dollar estimate.
 * - `dining-dollars` — exactly 0 meal swipes, one required structured
 *   order-details value, and a required Dining Dollar estimate.
 *
 * Currency is carried as an exact integer count of cents, never a float:
 * `12.34` is `1234`, and no accepted user-visible value can acquire
 * floating-point rounding behaviour on the way through validation,
 * persistence, projection, or W3-D1 replay.
