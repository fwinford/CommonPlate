/**
 * `POST /api/request-operation/terminal` (W4-D2).
 *
 * Exact-operation terminal reconciliation for one already-issued W3-D1
 * request-create operation, named only by the same
 * `x-commonplate-operation-id` header `POST /api/request` reads, and only
 * against the ledger authority named by `x-commonplate-operation-authority`
 * (`requestOperationAuthority.ts`): a missing, malformed, or different
 * authority is refused before the ledger is touched, because no answer from
 * another ledger — not even NO-CREATE written into it — says anything about
 * the operation. Takes no body and never reads request content: it exists for
 * recovery that cannot, or must not, resend the original payload.
 *
 * For the verified participant, it answers exactly one terminal outcome:
 *
 * - `200 { outcome: "created", request }` — this identity created that
 *   Request, the same projection replay returns;
 * - `200 { outcome: "not-created" }` — terminal NO-CREATE, established now
 *   or earlier; this identity never created and never will;
 * - `410 OPERATION_EXPIRED` — it created a Request that is gone;
 * - `403 OPERATION_UNAUTHORIZED` — the identity belongs to someone else,
 *   refused with the same generic answer replay gives.
 *
 * Anything else (participant or ledger-authority refusal, malformed
 * identity, pause, rate limit, database failure) is not a terminal answer
 * about the operation. The only
 * write this route can perform is the NO-CREATE ledger row: no quota is
 * counted or consumed, no email or push is sent, and no Request is created.
