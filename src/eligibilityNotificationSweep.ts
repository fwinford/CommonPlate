/**
 * Eligibility-time helper-notification initiation (W3-N3).
 *
 * The product event that starts helper notification is **the request becoming
 * helper-eligible**. For an ASAP request that is its creation instant, and
 * `POST /api/request` already dispatches both channels there. For a future
 * Later request (W3-R1) it is `visibleFrom`, which can arrive hours later —
 * long after any creation-time lookback would still find the request. Nothing
 * else in the system watches for that instant, so without this sweep a Later
 * request is correctly withheld at creation and then permanently missed.
 *
 * This module adds no notification behavior of its own. It is discovery and
 * initiation only: it finds requests that have just become helper-eligible and
 * calls the same two dispatchers the create route calls, with the same
 * recipient eligibility, the same deduplication, the same provider
 * classification, and the same payloads.
 *
 * ## Why a periodic sweep of persisted state
 *
 * The alternative — an in-process timer armed at creation for each future Later
 * request — cannot survive a restart, and a restart between creation and
 * `visibleFrom` is exactly the case the contract requires not to lose. Durable
 * state plus a sweep is the smallest mechanism that is correct across restarts
 * without introducing a queue or a second worker process: the request row is
 * already durable, already TTL-bounded, and already carries `visibleFrom`.
 *
 * ## Why the state is marked after dispatch, not before
 *
 * Claim-before-work is the right shape when the work cannot be repeated safely.
 * Here it can: `SendLog`'s unique `(requestId, subscriberId)` claim and
 * `PushDelivery`'s unique `(requestId, installationId, purpose)` claim already
 * make a repeated dispatch a no-op per recipient, and both dispatchers were
 * written for concurrent dispatches of one request. Marking first would
 * therefore buy nothing and cost the one guarantee the contract asks for: a
 * process killed between the mark and the send would have permanently consumed
 * the request's only chance. Marking after means an interrupted run leaves the
 * request exactly as it found it, and the next sweep retries it — through the
 * existing per-recipient guards, never through a second submission path.
 *
 * ## Why "after dispatch" is not the same as "after the promise resolves"
 *
 * Both dispatchers can resolve perfectly normally having initiated nothing —
 * paused, the request no longer effectively available at the instant that
 * channel looked, or a delivery-ledger claim that could not be written. Reading
 * resolution as completion would consume the request's one initiation on work
 * that never happened, and a request that became eligible again afterwards
 * would be permanently undiscoverable. Each channel therefore reports
 * `"processed"` or `"retryable"` (`src/helperNotificationInitiation.ts`), and
 * the state moves only when both say `"processed"`. This adds no provider
 * retry: every existing terminal provider outcome stays terminal.

 * never find it and it would be withheld at creation and then never announced.
 *
 * Three clauses, and each one is load-bearing:
 *
 * - `helperNotification: {$exists: false}` — every request created since this
 *   slice carries the field, so this can only ever match a pre-deployment row.
 *   The branch retires itself: `deleteAt` removes the last of these within
 *   hours, after which it matches nothing.
 * - `windowStart: {$type: "date"}` — the request was created through a
 *   scheduled shape. An ASAP request has no `windowStart`.
 * - `visibleFrom > createdAt` — helper eligibility began *after* creation,
 *   which is the actual definition of what this slice exists to catch. A row
 *   with no `visibleFrom` at all — a genuinely old pre-W3-R1 row that cannot
 *   prove it is a future Later request — fails this comparison and is left
 *   alone, which is why this is not a legacy migration. An ASAP request fails
 *   it too: its `visibleFrom` is the handler's `now`, captured before the
 *   write, so `createdAt` is always the later of the two.
 *
 * Anything this branch does find is protected by the same per-recipient
 * `SendLog` and `PushDelivery` claims as everything else, so a transition row
 * that somehow already had a channel initiated cannot be notified twice.
 *
 * The partial index only covers the awaiting state, so this branch is a scan.
 * That is acceptable for a population that is bounded by one deployment and
 * expires within hours of it.
