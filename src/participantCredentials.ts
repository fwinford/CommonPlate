 * about different subjects, and a compromise of one must not forge another.
 * `PARTICIPANT_SIGNING_SECRET` is therefore its own variable, read only here.
 *
 * The two things derived from it are separated again, by canonical prefix, so
 * an emailed verification code can never be replayed as a participant
 * authority credential and neither can be confused with a future format:
 *
 * - `commonplate:participant-code:v1:<principal>:<code>` — the stored digest of
 *   a live challenge. The code is bound to the address it was mailed to, so a
 *   code issued for one participant cannot verify another.
 * - `commonplate:participant-authority:v1:<participantId>:<version>` — the
 *   signature inside the credential the app holds after verifying.
 *
 * Nothing raw is persisted on either side: the challenge row stores only the
 * HMAC digest, and the authority credential is a signature over identity the
 * Participant document already carries, recomputed on demand.
