# CommonPlate verification guide

## 1. Verification overview

| Type | Command | Purpose | Important limitation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript checking | `npm run typecheck` | Checks the TypeScript source and tests without emitting files. | It does not exercise runtime behavior. |
| Backend unit/source-wiring tests | `npm test` | Runs Vitest unit, browser-behavior, and source-wiring tests. | Mongo suites are skipped without their integration environment. |
| Mongo integration tests | `npm run test:mongo` | Runs the real-Mongo replica-set suites. | Requires local `mongod` and `mongosh`. |
| Browser bundle generation | `npm run build:client` | Rebuilds tracked browser bundles from client TypeScript. | A successful build does not decide whether bundle diffs are intended. |
| iOS tests | See [section 9](#9-complete-terminal-ios-test-command). | Builds and runs `CommonPlateiosTests` on a simulator. | Compilation alone is not a passing test run. |
| Diff validation | `git diff --check` | Detects whitespace errors in unstaged changes. | It does not establish behavioral correctness. |

## 2. Node and dependency setup

Install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

The repository supplies npm scripts and dependency versions in `package.json`; it does not declare a Node version. Configure local runtime values by copying `.env.example` to an untracked `.env` and replacing placeholders with local development values. Never copy secrets, real URIs, or personal values into tracked files.

For app startup, the configured MongoDB deployment must support transactions; a local single-member replica set is sufficient. The test runner itself does not require app startup.

## 3. TypeScript checking

Run:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

This runs `tsc -p tsconfig.typecheck.json`. That configuration checks the application, `src`, browser-client source, scripts, and TypeScript test files with no emitted output. The production `tsconfig.json` intentionally excludes `**/*.test.ts`, so `npm run build` does not emit tests or require Vitest types in a production install.

Typechecking validates static TypeScript compatibility; it does not validate routes, MongoDB transactions, email-provider behavior, browser execution, or iOS behavior.

## 4. Backend unit and source-wiring tests

Run:

```bash
npm test
```

The current accepted baseline is **266 passed, 27 Mongo-gated skipped**. Skipped Mongo suites are not failures. This command does not execute the real-Mongo transactional suite; run `npm run test:mongo` separately.

Representative coverage includes validation, route logic, error envelopes, browser behavior, copy guards, and source-wiring assertions. Some tests read source text instead of importing `app.ts`, because `app.ts` connects to MongoDB and starts listening at module scope. These assertions are not end-to-end route tests.

Consequences:

- Broad `app.ts` formatting or route-registration changes can break source-text assertions.
- README and web-copy changes can be pinned by tests.
- A repository-wide production-source guard rejects the phrase `within the next hour`.

## 5. Mongo integration tests

Run:

```bash
npm run test:mongo
```

The current accepted baseline is **27 passed**. `mongod` and `mongosh` must both be on `PATH`. The script creates a temporary data directory, starts a temporary single-member replica set on a free local port, initializes it, injects an isolated `MONGO_INTEGRATION_URI`, runs `*.mongo.test.ts`, and removes the temporary database directory afterward.

A replica set is required because placement verification exercises MongoDB transactions; standalone MongoDB cannot provide that behavior. Mongo verification remains incomplete until this command passes. `npm test` reporting the Mongo suites as skipped does not replace this run.

`MONGO_INTEGRATION_URI` is an integration-test environment input. Do not set it to a real shared or production URI.

## 6. Browser-client bundles

Edit `src/client/*.ts`; never edit `public/js/*.js` directly. Rebuild with:

```bash
npm run build:client
```

The generated bundles are tracked and begin with a generated-file banner. After rebuilding, inspect `git diff` and confirm that only expected bundle changes are present. Current tooling does not independently fail CI merely because regenerated bundles differ, so the reviewer must verify the diff. No generated-output enforcement check exists.

## 7. iOS prerequisites

Full Xcode is required; Command Line Tools alone are insufficient. Verify the selected developer directory with:

```bash
xcode-select -p
```

The expected form is `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`. Correct it when necessary with:

```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

The project is `ios/CommonPlateios/CommonPlateios.xcodeproj`; its shared scheme is `CommonPlateios` and its unit-test target is `CommonPlateiosTests`. The project targets iOS 26.5, so use Xcode with the required SDK and simulator runtime.

## 8. Discovering an available simulator

Run:

```bash
xcrun simctl list devices available
```

Choose an available iPhone simulator from that output and copy its UDID into the test command. Do not assume a particular model exists on every machine.

## 9. Complete terminal iOS test command

```bash
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer xcodebuild test \
  -project ios/CommonPlateios/CommonPlateios.xcodeproj \
  -scheme CommonPlateios \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=<AVAILABLE_SIMULATOR_UDID>' \
  -derivedDataPath /tmp/CommonPlate-Tests-DerivedData \
  -only-testing:CommonPlateiosTests
```

The current accepted baseline is **258 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, TEST SUCCEEDED**. Compilation alone is not a passing test result: the result bundle must complete and the output must contain `TEST SUCCEEDED`. Xcode GUI and terminal runs use the same shared scheme and `CommonPlateiosTests` target.

## 10. Test-file organization

Add new Week 3 iOS tests in new focused files where practical. Do not keep extending `ClaimFlowTests.swift` merely because it already contains related tests. Preserve existing test files rather than splitting them during unrelated feature work, and keep one endpoint and one user-flow slice per test change. This does not prescribe a new test framework or UI-test target.

## 11. Verification by change type

| Change | Minimum verification |
| --- | --- |
| Backend TypeScript only | Typecheck, focused tests, and `npm test`. |
| Mongo mutation/transaction | The backend checks above plus `npm run test:mongo`. |
| Browser source | Focused browser tests, typecheck, and `npm run build:client`. |
| iOS production or test change | Focused tests plus the complete `CommonPlateiosTests` target. |
| Cross-stack contract | All affected backend and iOS suites. |
| Comment/document-only | `git diff --check` and content review; run tests only when executable behavior is also pending in the same working tree. |

`npm run ci-check` runs lint, typecheck, prune, and build. It does not run the test suites.

## 12. Final diff checks

Run:

```bash
git diff --check
git diff --cached --check
git status
```

Before committing, inspect generated files, new tracked documentation, and deleted files; each must be intentional. Confirm that local weekly specifications and archived working documents under `docs/` remain ignored and unstaged.

## 13. Current verification baseline

Week 2 closeout results are a reference baseline, not a substitute for rerunning affected checks after future changes.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run typecheck` | Passed |
| `npm test` | 266 passed; 27 Mongo-gated skipped |
| `npm run test:mongo` | 27 passed |
| `CommonPlateiosTests` | 258 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped |
| `npm run build:client` | Passed |
| `git diff --check` | Passed |
