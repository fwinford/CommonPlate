// Wire-level types for `PUT /api/installations/push`
// (`src/installationPushRoute.ts`, Week 3 Day 6 Slice 6A). Kept separate from
// `SubscriptionDTOs.swift`: push and email share no endpoint, no response
// shape, and no privacy rule.
//
// Two distinct request types rather than one with optional fields, so an
// enabled request missing a token and a disabled request carrying one are
// both impossible to construct, not merely invalid at runtime. The backend's
// body schema is `.strict()` on both branches: a disable body that includes
// `apnsToken` or `environment` is rejected outright, so this client must
// never send either key when disabling — not even as `null`.
