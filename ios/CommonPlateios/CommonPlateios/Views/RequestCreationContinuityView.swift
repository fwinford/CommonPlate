// Why this lives above the navigation stack rather than inside Request Food:
// the accepted contract requires the *same* card the requester sees on
// Success to land in Home's first requester-owned slot, with Home already
// visible by the landing and with no width, wrapping, position, scale, or
// visibility jump at the handoff. A view pushed inside `NavigationStack`
// cannot reveal Home beneath itself, and cannot know Home's real slot
// geometry — so a Success-layer card could only ever be replaced by an
// independently laid-out Home card, which is the defect this replaces.
// Presenting the continuity as one overlay sibling of the stack (the same
// architecture `HelperSuccessView` already uses for W4-H1) lets one
// continuously mounted card travel into geometry measured from Home's actual
// first slot.
//
// This view is presentation only. It holds no create, ownership, recovery, or
// navigation authority: `RequestStore` has already authoritatively confirmed
// CREATED, resolved ownership, and inserted the card into the collection Home
// renders before this can exist, and `RequestCreationContinuity`'s own
// identity decides whether a presentation is still current at all.
