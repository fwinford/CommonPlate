//
//  ReservationWarningRouteDriver.swift
//  CommonPlateios
//
// One reservation-warning notification tap turned into one navigation
// outcome (W3-H1), mirroring `HelperNotificationRouteDriver` — including the
// terminated-launch fix: a captured tap is retired only once its navigation
// outcome has actually been produced, so an attempt SwiftUI cancels before
// that (the cold-launch case) leaves the intent for the next attempt to find.
//
// The one real difference from the helper driver: there is no `requestId` to
// resolve against `GET /api/request/:id`, because "is this request still
// open" is not the question. The question is "do I still hold this exact
// reservation", which is `continueActiveReservationIfNeeded()`'s job — the
// same read `ContentView`'s own launch-time `.task` already performs, called
// again here so this driver is self-contained and correct even if that
// separate call has not finished yet.
import Foundation

/// What the driver needs from `RequestStore`: its current in-memory active
/// claim, the same continuation read `RequestStore` already exposes, and the
/// existing "gone" recovery notice every other notification-resolution
/// outcome in this app already uses.
