//
// The one state owner for CommonPlate push-notification preference (Week 3
// Day 6 Slice 6A.2). Coordinates installation identity, Apple's notification
// permission, APNs device-token registration, and backend synchronization
// through `InstallationPushService`.
//
// Deliberately separate from `AlertSubscriptionStore` and `RequestStore`: per
// the Week 3 Day 6 cross-slice contract, email alerts and push notifications
// are independent controls with no shared state, error semantics, or backend
// endpoint. This sends no notification and never touches email state.
//
// `state` is truthful by construction. It becomes `.on` only after Apple
// permission allows notifications, an APNs token was received, and the
// backend confirmed `enabled: true` — never optimistically. Turning push off
// follows the same rule in reverse: `.off` is shown only after the backend
// confirms `enabled: false`, and a failed disable preserves the last
// confirmed `.on` state rather than claiming delivery stopped.
