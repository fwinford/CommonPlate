//
// One helper new-request tap turned into one navigation outcome, kept out of
// `ContentView` so the terminated-launch ordering this exists to fix can be
// driven by an ordinary test instead of only by a physical device.
//
// The rule this type enforces: a captured tap is retired only once its
// navigation outcome has actually been produced. An attempt that never gets
// that far — the cold-launch case, where SwiftUI cancels the root view's
// `.task` while the scene and store hierarchy are still being established —
// leaves the intent exactly as it found it, so the next attempt (the rebuilt
// view's own `.task`, or the scene becoming active) still has a tap to route.
// No delay is involved: nothing here waits for readiness, it simply refuses to
// destroy routing intent it has not yet honoured.
//
// Availability itself is still never inferred from the payload. `requestId` is
// routing context; only `resolveHelperNotificationRequest(id:)`'s answer from
// `GET /api/request/:id` decides the destination.
