//
//  AlertSubscriptionStore.swift
//  CommonPlateios
//
// The one state owner for email alert signup. Coordinates
// AlertSubscriptionService and updates local state only after a confirmed
// backend response, per docs/system-contract.md. Owns no SwiftUI screen.
//
// Deliberately not part of RequestStore: alert signup is not a request
// operation, shares none of its collection, claim, or placement state, and
// must never inherit request-shaped error recovery. There is exactly one owner
// here — no separate view model sits beside it.
//
// One thing here outlives the process: the `Check your email` presentation, so
// reopening the app does not silently forget that a signup was submitted. What
// is written is presentation history — the address submitted and when the
// generic accepted response arrived — and never subscription truth. See
// AlertSignupPresentationStorage.swift. Everything else, including the draft
// field and every failure state, is session-only.
