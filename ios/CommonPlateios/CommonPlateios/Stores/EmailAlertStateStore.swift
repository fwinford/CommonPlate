//  EmailAlertStateStore.swift
//  CommonPlateios
//
// The one state owner for the W4-N0 authoritative Email Request Alert state
// read. Entirely separate from `AlertSubscriptionStore` (signup presentation
// history) and `ParticipantEmailUnsubscribeStore` (the participant-authorized
// Off mutation): neither of those is Subscriber truth, and this store never
// reads or writes either one's state. `AlertSubscriptionStore`'s local
// `Check your email` presentation history is never treated as this store's
// truth (docs/system-contract.md section 9.9).
//
// `state` becomes `.active`/`.inactive` only after the backend answers under
// the participant authority that is still current *at the moment `state` is
// read*; `.unknown` covers "not yet read", "read failed", "credential
// unusable", and "resolved under a since-replaced identity" alike, so a
// caller can never mistake an unresolved or superseded read for a confirmed
// On or Off. Session-only, like the stores it sits beside: nothing here is
// persisted across launches.
