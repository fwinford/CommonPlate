// Local continuity for the alert-signup `Check your email` screen across app
// launches. This is presentation history and nothing else.
//
// What a saved record means is exactly: this installation previously submitted
// this address and received CommonPlate's generic accepted response. It does
// not prove that a Subscriber exists, that the address is pending, that a
// confirmation email was submitted or delivered, that the address was
// confirmed, that alerts are active, that the address is still subscribed, or
// that the person still controls it. The generic 202 is identical for a new,
// pending, confirmed, and unsubscribed address (docs/system-contract.md section
// 9.1), so no local record derived from it may be read as subscription status —
// which is why nothing here is named for one.
//
// The address is presentation data, not a credential, and is deliberately not
// in the Keychain: the app keeps no comparable preference there, and a stored
// email is not a secret.
