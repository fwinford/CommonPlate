//
// Owns `POST /api/subscribe` endpoint knowledge, per docs/system-contract.md.
// Talks to the backend only through APIClient; never calls URLSession
// directly. Contains no SwiftUI state and no user-facing copy, and never
// retries a signup automatically.
//
// This is deliberately separate from RequestService. The request lifecycle and
// the subscription lifecycle share no state, no response shape, and no error
// semantics, and folding one into the other would give both a surface that is
// wrong for at least one of them.
