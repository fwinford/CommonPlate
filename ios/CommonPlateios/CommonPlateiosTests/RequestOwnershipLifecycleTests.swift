// Focused W4-H2 coverage for the participant-authority *lifecycle* around
// caller-relative request ownership — the boundary `RequestOwnershipTests`
// (wire decoding) does not reach.
//
// Caller-relative ownership is only ever true relative to one exact
// participant authority. These cases prove that a result produced under one
// authority can never become ownership truth for another, that ownership with
// no current-authority evidence behind it fails closed instead of reading as
// an actionable "not own", and that a request this app just created under a
// still-current authenticated authority is recognised as the caller's own
// immediately.
//
// Behavioural throughout: every case drives the real
// `RequestStore`/`RequestService` path over a stubbed transport, rather than
// asserting on source text.
