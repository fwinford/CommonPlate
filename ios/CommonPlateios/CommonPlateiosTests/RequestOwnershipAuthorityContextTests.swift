// Focused W4-H2 coverage for the ownership *wire mapping* and the claim
// boundary that depends on it.
//
// The wire has three meaningful states — `true`, `false`, and absent — and
// absence means different things depending on something only this client
// knows: whether it presented a participant credential. Mapping absence to a
// flat `false` is what previously let an unusable credential, or a response
// shape that derives no ownership at all, read as an authoritative "not your
// request" and expose helper actions.
//
// Also covers the same-principal reverification hole: an anonymous browser
// legitimately sees a request as `.notOwn`, taps Help, verifies as the very
// participant who owns it, and must not go on to claim their own request.
