// Focused W3-I4 coverage: `ParticipantIdentityStore.removeIdentity()` — what
// it clears, what it leaves alone, and that a caller cannot use it while a
// verification flow is running. The removal-safety *gating* Settings applies
// (`SettingsView.isRemoveEmailBlocked`) is `!requestStore.hasEstablishedRemovalSafety
// || requestStore.activeClaim != nil || requestStore.hasUnresolvedCreateAmbiguity
// || requestStore.isCreating` (the last disjunct added by the W4-D2 FIX
// 2026-09-18 independent-review MUST FIX; see
// `RemoveEmailInFlightCreateGatingTests.swift` for its focused coverage) by
// source inspection; this file proves those published `RequestStore`
// signals hold exactly when the accepted removal-safety matrix says Remove
// Email must be unavailable, reusing the same store construction other
// focused H1/D1 suites already use. `hasEstablishedRemovalSafety` is the
// fail-closed cold/relaunch-reconciliation readiness gate: it starts `false`
// on a freshly constructed store and is established only by a definitive
// H1 continuation/claim outcome and a definitive D1
// reconciliation/create outcome, never by an inconclusive one.
