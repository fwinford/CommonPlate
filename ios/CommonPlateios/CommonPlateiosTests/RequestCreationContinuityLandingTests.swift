// Focused W4-D2 coverage for the two structural properties of the
// Success→Home handoff that a state-only test cannot reach: the card is the
// same width on Success and on Home, and its landing geometry comes from
// Home's *real* first requester-owned slot rather than a tuned offset.
//
// Scope honesty (`docs/testing.md`): this repository has no UI-test target, so
// these cases exercise the production layout and motion rules directly — the
// same pure functions and constants the views call — plus bounded source
// assertions for the two wiring facts that have no non-UI seam (Home
// publishing its slot frame, and the in-flight slot rendering invisibly rather
// than collapsing). They prove the rules and the wiring. They do not prove
// rendered geometry, smoothness, or the absence of a visible jump on a
// device; that remains physical-device evidence.
