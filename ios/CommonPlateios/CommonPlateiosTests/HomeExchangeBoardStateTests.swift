// Focused W4-H2 coverage for `HomeExchangeView.boardState`, the pure
// derivation behind Home's populated/low-activity, empty (E1), and
// unavailable (U4) board presentation. Exercised directly, without
// instantiating `RequestStore`, matching this target's existing
// testable-`static-func` pattern.
