// Focused coverage for the W4-D2 physical-device FIX: the progressive Home
// reveal that makes an overlap between the travelling continuity card and an
// existing Home request card structurally impossible, the stable-measurement
// rule that keeps the travel one continuous motion, and the landing travel
// curve that replaced the micro-settle curve this travel had inherited.
//
// Scope honesty (`docs/testing.md`): this repository has no UI-test target, so
// these cases exercise the production policy and motion rules directly — the
// same pure functions and constants the views call — plus bounded source
// assertions for the wiring facts that have no non-UI seam. They prove the
// mechanism and the wiring. They do NOT prove rendered smoothness, rendered
// geometry, or the absence of a visible overlap on a device; that remains
// physical-device evidence and is still outstanding for this fix.
