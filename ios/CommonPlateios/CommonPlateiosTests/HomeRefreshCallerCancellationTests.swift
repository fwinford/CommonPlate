//
// W4-H4 physical-device refresh defect. Faith seeded new open requests while
// Home was already running, pulled to refresh, and the board did not change;
// the same requests appeared immediately after a force-quit relaunch.
//
// Instrumented simulator reproduction established the cause: SwiftUI cancels
// `.refreshable`'s own action task as soon as the view owning the modifier is
// invalidated, and the refresh itself invalidates Home the instant it starts
// (`RequestStore.fetchRequests()` publishes `isRefreshingRequests`, which
// `HomeExchangeView` observes). That cancellation landed ~15-40 ms into every
// pull. `HomeExchangeView.awaitWithDeadline` ran the authoritative fetch as a
// *structured child* of that task, so the child inherited the cancellation and
// the in-flight `GET /api/requests` was cancelled before it could resolve.
// `fetchRequests()` then correctly treated `CancellationError` as "no answer"
// and returned without touching `requests` — so newly available authoritative
// requests could never reach the rendered board without relaunching, while the
// cold-launch `.task` load (never tied to the refresh action's lifetime)
// always worked.
//
// These are behavioral tests of the real composition — the production
// `awaitWithDeadline`, the production `RequestStore.fetchRequests()`, and a
// real `URLSession` behind the existing `RequestFetchingURLProtocol` stub —
// not source-text assertions. They do not, and cannot, prove the physical pull
// gesture itself; they prove the refresh path applies authoritative data when
// the calling task is cancelled exactly the way SwiftUI cancels it.
