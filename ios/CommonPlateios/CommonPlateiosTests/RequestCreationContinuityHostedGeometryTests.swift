//
//  RequestCreationContinuityHostedGeometryTests.swift
//  CommonPlateiosTests
//
// W4-D2 hosted regression coverage for the two proven physical-device
// geometry defects:
//
// 1. The named coordinate space `RequestCreationContinuityLayout` used to
//    declare did not resolve across `NavigationStack`'s own hosting
//    boundary — Home's published slot and the continuity overlay's own card
//    were being measured in two different origins and then subtracted,
//    landing the card ~62pt (the simulator's safe-area top inset) below
//    Home's real slot on the diagnosis device. The fix measures both in
//    `.global` instead, which — unlike a name declared above the boundary —
//    is anchored to the window and resolves identically on both sides of it.
// 2. `homeSlotCapture.commit(homeSlotFrame)` ran inside a long-running
//    `.task` that read a plain `let` parameter — captured once, at whichever
//    render started the task — rather than the latest value actually
//    delivered to this presentation before the commit. The fix mirrors the
//    parameter into `@State` (`latestHomeSlotFrame`) and commits that
//    instead.
//
// This supersedes the temporary, assertion-free
// `D2DiagnosticCoordinateSpaceProbeTests` diagnosis probe (deleted). These
// mount the real production `RequestCreationContinuityView`,
// `HomeOwnedRequestSlotFrameKey` wiring, and a real `NavigationStack`-hosted
// Home slot in a UIWindow with the simulator's own non-zero safe area, then
// read the actually-drawn pixels — not a reconstructed value — for where the
// continuity card ends up, matching this repository's only available
// hosted-proof technique (`docs/testing.md`: no UI-test target).
//
// Scope honesty: this proves rendered end-state geometry against Home's real
// slot for the scenarios below. It does not replace physical-device
// verification of smoothness or the absence of a visible jump mid-travel.
