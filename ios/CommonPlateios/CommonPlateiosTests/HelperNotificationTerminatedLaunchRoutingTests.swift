//  CommonPlateiosTests
//
// The terminated-launch helper-tap defect, at the highest level an automated
// test can actually reach.
//
// Reproduced on a physical iPhone: CommonPlate force-quit, a helper
// new-request push delivered, the notification tapped, the app launched — and
// landed on Home instead of the tapped request. Foreground and background taps
// routed correctly, so the defect was never in the payload, the delegate, the
// backend resolution, or the destination mapping; all of those are already
// covered in `HelperNotificationRoutingTests`.
//
// What is different about a cold launch is that the tap is captured before the
// SwiftUI scene and its stores exist, and the first routing attempt can be
// cancelled while that hierarchy is still being established. The old code read
// and cleared the pending tap in one step *before* awaiting
// `GET /api/request/:id`, then swallowed the resulting `CancellationError` —
// so a cancelled first attempt destroyed the only record of the tap and left
// navigation at Home permanently, with no second attempt able to recover it.
//
// These tests drive `HelperNotificationRouteDriver` — the exact code
// `ContentView`'s `.task` and its scene-active retry both call — against a
// real `HelperNotificationRouter` and a real `RequestStore` over a stubbed
// transport, so the resolution rules under test are the production ones. The
// only thing simulated is the cancellation, which is the whole point.
//
// What no test here can establish: whether the OS actually delivers the
// launch-time `didReceive response:` callback to the delegate at all on a real
// terminated launch. `UNNotificationResponse` has no public initializer, so
// that boundary stays physical-device acceptance territory.
