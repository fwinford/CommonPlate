// W4-H4 review follow-up (ACTIVE / FIX): the existing `ownRequestsPreview`
// coverage in HomeExchangeBoardStateTests exercises an already-partitioned
// `owned` array — it proves the 0/1/2/3+ preview shape but not the upstream
// invariant that every caller-owned request in a mixed authoritative board
// is excluded from `Needs help right now`, including an owned request beyond
// the two-card Home preview. This file exercises the production
// `HomeExchangeView.partitionByOwnership` seam directly — the same function
// `ownRequests` and `populatedBoard(_:)` both derive from — against a mixed
// authoritative list, without duplicating its filtering algorithm.
